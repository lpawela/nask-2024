### Motivation

- Apply methods from solid-state physics to construct novel algorithm for solving spin-glass problems.
  - Can exploit limitted connectivity (topology) of the annealer.
  - How would such algorithms compare to the real physical device?

## Comparison with other heuristics

![Comparisons with other heuristics. Here, time to solution is defined as $TTS = T\frac{\log(1-p_{target})}{\log(1-p_{succ})}$, where $T$ is running time, and $p_{target}$, $p_{succ}$ are desired and empirical success probability. In the whole table, we used $p_{target}=0.99$](figs/tn-results.png)

# Brute-forcing spin-glass problems using CUDA

---

## Motivation

- Create a way for benchmarking other heuristic algorithms.
  - Can certify solution.
  - In fact, can compute exact low energy spectrum.
  - Easily parallelizable on CUDA-enabled GPUs.
- The goal: create the fastest brute-force solver on the market.

![https://github.com/euro-hpc-pl/omnisolver, https://github.com/euro-hpc-pl/omnisolver-bruteforce](figs/omnisolver.png)

## General idea
![](figs/bf_idea.png)

## Key obstacles

- How to distribute work among threads?

  **Naive solution**: process states in chunks, map one state in chunk to one thread.

  **Better solution**: use strided loop to allow fine-tuning kernel parameters.

- How to compute energies?

  **Naive solution**: Compute each energy separately.

  **Better solution**: Iterate states in particular order to exploit regularities.


## Initial benchmarks
![**a.** Time to solution of the first implementation of brute-force algoirthm. **b.** Speedup of CUDA and multi-core implementation over single-core implementation. Tests were performed on random generated instances defined on complete graphs. Computed low energy spectrum comprised K=100 states.](figs/bf1.png)

## Improvements of the algorithm
- Instead of natural order, enumerate states in Gray-code order.
- Consecutive numbers differ with one bit $\rightarrow$ significantly simpler energy update.
- Regularities in Gray code can be exploited to build cache of partial updates.
- Some common computations can be extracted to CPU, and the CPU-GPU work can be overlapped.

# Simulated bifurcation machines

## General principle

![Introductory reference](figs/sbm-paper.png)

Consider equations of motion
$$
y_i(t_{k+1}) = y_i(t_k) + \left\{ -\left[ a_0 - a(t_k) \right]x_i(t_k) + c_0 \sum_{j=1}^N  J_{ij} \mathrm{sgn}\left[x_j(t_k)\right] \right\} \Delta_t
$$
$$
x_i(t_{k+1}) = x_i(t_k) + a_0 y_i(t_{k+1}) \Delta_t
$$
where $a(t)$ increses from zero to one.
At the end set
$$
s_i = \mathrm{sgn}(x_i)
$$

# Summary

## Contributions

- Design and implementation of strategies for testing quantum annealers and beyond.
- Benchmarking them on the available annealing devices.
- Development of classical algorithms for solving spin-glass problems.

## What's the current state of quantum annealers?

- Current generation of D-Wave annealers underperforms in both academic and real-life applications, as compared to classical heuristics.
- There are noticeable improvements in newer generations of annealers.
  - If this trend continues, at some point the annealers may deliver the promised advantage in certain optimization problems.
  - Hard to predict when this could happen.
- Biggest advantage of quantum annealers so far: fueling development of classical algorithms either inspired by the annealers (e.g. tensor-network based), or designed to benchmark them (e.g. bruteforce algorithm).
- ML?
